* Introduction

  Modular loading of Emacs configuration.

  Small utility library that loads all Lisp files located in the
  directory indicated by `startupd-path'. Files are filtered by the
  `startupd-file-name-regexp' and the loading order is determined by
  the function defined in `startupd-file-loading-sort-function'. By
  default the file loading order is done by using `string<' and
  byte-compiled versions always take precedence.

* Requirements

  This package was tested with GNU/Emacs 23 only, it should work with
  others versions too but I can't ensure anything. Besides from that
  nothing else is required.

* Installation/Usage

  Add this to your .emacs:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/folder/containing/file")
  (require 'startupd)
  (startupd-load-files)
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  The default startupd folder is "~/.emacs.d/startup.d/".

  The default regexp used to indentify startup files matches things
  like "00functions.el", "50org.el", etc. That means a two digit
  number followed by a letter, followed by any number of alphanumeric,
  "-" and "_" and ending in ".el" or ".elc". If a byte-compiled
  version of a file exists it *always takes precedence*.

* Bug Reports
